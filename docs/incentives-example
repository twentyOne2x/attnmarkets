# Pump.fun creator incentives (example based on A5RH5EVE…)

Link: https://pump.fun/profile/A5RH5EVEkUnEfpWvz7b94NqzsforWk63mLcujoXVKiHs?tab=coins

This page sketches how attn could detect high-earning Pump.fun creators on-chain and surface instant, personalised funding offers.

The concrete example here is the creator address `A5RH5EVEkUnEfpWvz7b94NqzsforWk63mLcujoXVKiHs`, which (over the last month window on Pump.fun):

- shows **~$113.9k** creator rewards (**~820 SOL**)  
- with the first few days around:
  - day 1: **~$3.5k**  
  - day 2: **~$37k**  
  - day 3: **~$16k**  
  - day 4: **~$15k**  
  - and multiple later days in the mid–high four figures

This is exactly the profile of a creator who should see:

- “you can claim an attn revenue account right now”  
- “here is what a short-dated advance or credit line would look like, sized from your Pump.fun income.”

---

## 1. What we are trying to surface

For creators like this, attn wants to show:

- **Instant preview of credit capacity** (e.g. “based on your last 10 days of creator rewards, you could access up to $20k in short-dated funding”).  
- **Simple products**:
  - 30-day revenue advances backed by future creator rewards.  
  - Small revolving lines that refill as new rewards land.  
- **A clean revenue account**:
  - creator rewards re-pointed to a Squads/attn revenue vault,  
  - unencumbered balances earning simple yield.

The surface-level UX should feel like:

> “You earned $113,900 in the last 11 days.  
> Route your Pump.fun creator rewards to attn and unlock up to **$X,XXX** right now, with everything repaid from a share of next month’s rewards.”

## 2. Onchain detection pipeline

**Inputs**

- Pump.fun program events (creator_reward mints, fee routing).  
- Creator reward balances by address and time window.  
- Basic volatility stats (peak days vs baseline).

**Heuristics (first pass)**

Define a 3-band segmentation:

- **Tier S – breakout creators**
  - 7-day creator rewards ≥ $50k  
  - at least 3 days ≥ $10k each  
- **Tier A – strong baseline**
  - 7-day creator rewards between $10k and $50k  
  - at least 5 reward days in the last 10 days  
- **Tier B – emerging**
  - 7-day creator rewards between $2.5k and $10k  
  - consistent revenues for ≥ 5 days

The example profile above clearly sits in **Tier S**.

For each tier we compute:

- `avg_daily_7d` – average daily rewards over 7 days  
- `credit_preview` – a fraction of `avg_daily_7d * 30`:

  - Tier S: `credit_preview = min( 0.20 × avg_daily_7d × 30, 25_000 )`  
  - Tier A: `credit_preview = min( 0.15 × avg_daily_7d × 30, 15_000 )`  
  - Tier B: `credit_preview = min( 0.10 × avg_daily_7d × 30, 7_500 )`

For the address `A5RH5…`:

- assume rough `avg_daily_7d ≈ $10–12k` (from the sequence 3.5k / 37k / 16k / 15k / …).  
- Tier S rule → `credit_preview ≈ 0.20 × 10,000 × 30 = $60k`, capped at **$25k** in this sketch.

So the UI can safely say something like:

> “Based on your recent rewards, you are pre-qualified for up to **$25,000** in short-dated funding, automatically repaid from creator rewards.”

## 3. Product shapes for Pump.fun creators

### 3.1 Short-dated revenue advances

For this segment, positions should be:

- **Tenor**: 15–45 days, max.  
- **Share of rewards**: 20–35% of upcoming creator rewards.  
- **Repayment**: automatic from the creator rewards routed into the revenue account.  
- **Usage**: up-front cash for:
  - liquidity seeding,  
  - marketing pushes,  
  - small builds (games, tools, bots).

Example offer for `A5RH5…`:

- credit preview: $25,000  
- product: “Sell 30% of the next 30 days of creator rewards”  
- projected rewards: assume `avg_daily_30d ≈ $8k` → `$240k` in the month  
- 30% share → `$72k` capacity against which we price a $25k advance

In the interface, this is presented as:

- slider: “share of next 30 days rewards” (20–35%),  
- slider: “size of upfront funding”, capped by risk limits,  
- live readout of:
  - max monthly repayment share,  
  - projected completion date.

### 3.2 Rolling credit previews

Rather than only single advances, attn can offer:

- a **soft line** bounded by:
  - `monthly_limit = credit_preview` (e.g. $25k),  
  - maximum active tenor of 45 days per draw.

This is still implemented as a set of short-dated advance positions under the hood, but the creator sees:

- “Available to draw this month: $25,000”  
- “Used: $7,500”  
- “Next repayment checkpoint: 30 days; repaid automatically from 30% of creator rewards.”

## 4. Offer and claim flow

1. **Detection**  
   - Indexer flags wallet `A5RH5…` as Tier S.  
   - We compute credit preview and basic parameters.

2. **Outbound**  
   - Surface a non-intrusive CTA:
     - e.g. DM / reply from an attn account on X, or an in-app Pump.fun banner (if ever possible).  
   - Example message:
     - “You earned $113.9k in Pump.fun creator rewards this month. Route your creator rewards to an attn revenue account and unlock up to $25k in short-dated funding, auto-repaid from future rewards.”

3. **One-click setup**  
   - Creator lands on attn:  
     - Connects the `A5RH5…` wallet.  
     - Sees their recent reward chart mirrored.  
     - Clicks “Set up revenue account and redirect creator rewards.”  
   - Flow:
     - Create a Squads/attn revenue vault (joint config).  
     - Provide a new “creator rewards destination” address.  
     - Present exact routing instructions / helper transaction, so the creator can update Pump.fun routing in one click.

4. **Preview and accept a position**  
   - Once the routing is set, the UI enables:
     - a default pre-sized position (e.g. $10k / 30 days / 25% share),  
     - plus a “custom” mode within risk limits.  
   - Creator signs the position. Funds are delivered immediately.

5. **Afterwards**  
   - attn tracks realised creator rewards vs projections.  
   - If performance is strong and repayment is smooth:
     - raise `credit_preview`,  
     - gradually open true revolving lines with lower friction.

## 5. Guardrails and risk flags

- **Minimum sample size**: require at least N reward days and a minimum total (e.g. ≥ $10k in 7 days) before any non-toy preview.  
- **Decay on peaks**: treat single mega-days (e.g. $37k) with heavier discounting than a smooth series.  
- **Concentration caps**: avoid any single creator representing >X% of the attnUSD book.  
- **Fast shutdown**: if creator rewards dry up unexpectedly for several days, pause new advances until there is clarity.
