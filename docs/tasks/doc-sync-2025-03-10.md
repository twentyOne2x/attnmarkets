# Documentation Drift Tasks (2025-03-10)

## 1. README MVP Deliverables vs. Implementation
- **Issue:** `README.md` claims "Minimal PT/quote and attnUSD/quote AMM pools" are part of the MVP deliverables, but the `protocol/programs/amm` crate only exposes a placeholder instruction with no swap/liquidity logic. This overstates readiness for production usage.
- **Action:** Update `README.md` to clarify the AMM module is pending implementation, or land the missing pool/LP instructions before launch.

## 2. CreatorVault Governance Description
- **Issue:** Both `README.md` and `docs/attn-markets-backend-spec.md` describe a Squads 2-of-2 dual-admin model and a `collect_fees` instruction for CreatorVault. The current program stores a single `admin` key and does not expose any `collect_fees` handler (`protocol/programs/creator_vault/src/lib.rs`).
- **Action:** Either extend the program to match the documentation (dual admin fields + Pump CPI) or revise the docs to reflect the existing single-admin design and absence of fee collection CPI.

## 3. Frontend Spec vs. dapp-prod UI
- **Issue:** `docs/attn-markets-frontend-spec.md` outlines Creator CTO tracking, AMM swap/liquidity tabs, and attnUSD dashboards. The `apps/dapp-prod` implementation currently focuses on borrow/loan simulations (`app/creator/page.tsx`) and lacks the specified tabs and Live-mode gating described in the spec.
- **Action:** Reconcile the spec with the shipped UI: either scope down the document to match the current loan-oriented experience or reintroduce the documented PT/YT flows in the production app.

Please triage and assign these tasks to ensure public-facing docs accurately describe the shipped MVP.
